#TrainingYRHuman if yr leader leaves u home while she goes shopping, act very sad and needy until u get privileges to sleep in her bedroom
always begins by staring down the human in a stoic, statuesque manner to make it give you an after dinner treat #TrainingYRHuman #pets
shake so your collar tags rattle. this will make your #human turn & look at you. #TrainingYRHuman
#TrainingYRHuman: click yr teeth b4 agreeing to sit 2 remind human this is on yr terms & 2 maintain respect and control #akita #dogs

At walk's end act like you are a lot of FUN: spin in circles then jump into a down position. this may prolong yr walk! #trainingYRhuman
<<<sometimes humans just don't know which way to walk / don't be afraid to instruct them>>> #trainingyrhuman

Lay your head in their lap. Then you'll get all the rubs you deserve. Most humans are total suckers for this maneuver. #trainingYRhuman
